Welcome to the main webpage of logship. There isn't much content here yet. But ohhhhh there will be.

## What is the ship?

Logship is a metrics and logs collector / aggregator. The coming series of blob posts will describe the architecture
and the reasoning behind entering the business.
The driving push to building logship, is to provided businesses a cost effective, convenient way to collect their metrics
without relying on expensive cloud providers. We'll provide the software, you deploy it to your own infrastructure.
