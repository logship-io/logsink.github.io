We now have documentation for our subset of the Kusto Query Language! The docs are still a work in progress, but will help alleviate some of the difficulties while building queries on the backend. 

## Updates

This is one small step for the ship, but a giant steps for documentation on a locally deployed product.

* [Where Expression](/docs/kusto-where/)
* [Project Expression](/docs/kusto-project/)
* [OrderBy Expression](/docs/kusto-orderby/)
* [Limit Expression](/docs/kusto-limit/)

We'll keep improving these as time moves on.
