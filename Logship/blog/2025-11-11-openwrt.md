## Overview

OpenWrt deployment for the Logship Agent is now available. This release adds MUSL-based builds and an official, tested procedure for running the agent under OpenWrt’s procd init system.

## Start here

For the authoritative, step-by-step instructions (including supported targets, installation, configuration, procd service setup, and troubleshooting), follow:
[Guide](/docs/agent/targets/openwrt)

## Highlights

- MUSL builds
    - Lightweight binaries suitable for constrained OpenWrt devices.
- procd integration
    - Managed lifecycle with clean start/stop, restart behavior, and logging.
- Field-tested guidance
    - Commands, config paths, and operational tips are maintained in the OpenWrt guide.

## Notes

- The [Guide](/docs/agent/targets/openwrt) is the source of truth and will be updated as support expands.
- For issues or feedback, open an issue with environment details and the agent logs referenced in the guide.
