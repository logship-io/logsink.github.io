TLDR; All publicly-available logship services are now hosted in podman containers.

# We've made a terrible mistake
Managing a k3s deployment for the single node which hosts our public frontend was nothing but a nightmare. We went ahead an rolled it all back to podman + podman-compose. Having to work through helm was purely unnecessary overhead. We've rolled to a much simpled deployment system with a few containers and a simple nginx reverse proxy.
