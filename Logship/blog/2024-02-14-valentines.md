Logship would like to wish all of our users a happy Valentine's Day! We know you're out there and we're thinking about you.

We understand that things have been quiet from our side for a while, but we've been hard at work building the next-generation observability platform for the masses.

Stay tuned for more updates! We love you. :heart:
