Founded in 2021, **Logship** was built on the belief that your data belongs to you—not a third-party cloud metrics provider. We empower organizations to take back control by offering secure, efficient, and cost-effective observability solutions.

Our team brings together a diverse blend of experience from big tech, agile startups, and national defense. That range of expertise means we’ve tackled tough technical challenges from every angle—and we’re confident we can help you overcome yours.

Whether you're exploring a partnership, looking to integrate, or have questions about how we can support your business, we’re here to help.

Reach out at [contact@logship.io](mailto:contact@logship.io) and someone from our team will be in touch shortly.
