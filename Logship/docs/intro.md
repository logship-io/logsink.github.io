# Welcome
Welcome to the logship documentation!

## What's Logship?
Logship is a scalable, highly available, all-in-one platform for metrics, logging, and analytics. It's designed to be simple to host and deploy on commodity infrastructure.

### Solutions
* A massively scalable database and query engine for time-series data.
* CLI and UI tools for data management, configuration, and control.
* An open source agent for metrics and logs ingestion.

All of this easily deployed *almost* anywhere. See how easy it is to start collecting on your own observability platform.

### Why?
We're tired of cloud-based observability providers drawing users in with low introductory costs; meanwhile locking *your* data into *their* cloud and later charging big bills on everything they can (e.g. users, time series, alerts, resources, SSO). At Logship, we believe that your data is *your* data. Why wouldn’t it be? Whether it be a laptop, desktop, datacenter, homelab, or something in-between: Logship services give you total control. 

### Don’t pay to play
As you grow, Logship scales with your hardware. You don’t pay more. 

### Infinite horizontal scale
The more machines you have, the more Logship can parallelize your query workloads.

### Simple Deployment

A Logship deployment is made up of 3 components:
* Logship Management Service
* Logship Database
* Logship Agent

### Simple Management

We provide tools to make managing Logship easy in all environments:
* Logship UI: A web interface for managing and querying Logship.
* Logship CLI ([logsh](https://github.com/logship-io/logsh)): A command-line interface for managing and querying Logship.
