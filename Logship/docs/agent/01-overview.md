# Logship Agent

The Logship Agent is a powerful data collection tool that serves as a fundamental component in the Logship ecosystem. Designed to streamline the process of gathering and forwarding log data, this open-source agent provides a flexible and efficient solution for collection of observability data in various environments. Deployed alongside your services, you can easily configure detailed aggregation from multiple data sources (e.g. metrics, logs, traces) to be uploaded into your logship instance.

You can check out the source on Github at [`https://github.com/logship-io/logship-agent`](https://github.com/logship-io/logship-agent) or head to the next section to start collecting.
