# Welcome!

Welcome to Logship! We're excited to help you get started with our powerful observability platform. This guide will walk you through setting up your first Logship deployment in just a few minutes.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - For pulling example configurations and deployments
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) or [podman](https://podman.io/get-started) - For running Logship services in containers

This guide uses containers for simplicity, making it easy to get started regardless of your operating system. If you're familiar with containers and basic terminal commands, you'll be up and running in no time.
